# Solutions
I wrote two solutions; A simple one (doesn't handle the wurmple line) and a more complicated solution that caches and abstracts the API calls.

# Running the solution
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noam3j/pokeapi-interview-question.git
cd pokeapi-interview-question

# Set up a python vertual environment and install the requirements
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the solution
python solutions/python/simple-solution.py

# OR
python solutions/python/follow-up-solution.py
```
